## Abstract
Recently, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been widely adopted for community detection, because of its better interpretability. However, the existing NMF-based methods have the following three problems: 1. they directly transform the original network into community membership space, so it is difficult for them to capture the hierarchical information; 2. they often only pay attention to the topology of the network and ignore its node attributes; 3. it is hard for them to learn the global structure information necessary for community detection.  
Therefore, we propose a new community detection algorithm, named Contrastive Deep Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (CDNMF). Firstly, we deepen NMF to strengthen its capacity for information extraction. Subsequently, inspired by contrastive learning, our algorithm creatively constructs network topology and node attributes as two contrasting views. Furthermore, we utilize a debiased negative sampling layer and learn node similarity at the community level, thereby enhancing the suitability of our model for community detection. We conduct experiments on three public real graph datasets and the proposed model has achieved better results than state-of-the-art methods.
